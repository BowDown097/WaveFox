## Installation
1. Download the `chrome` folder and put it in the root folder (also known as the user profile folder)
2. Go to the `about:config` and switch the keys below:
* `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` > `True`
* `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` > `True`
* `layout.css.color-mix.enabled` > `True`
3. Select the desired shape of the tabs. Ð¡reate one of the keys below:
* `Style.Proton` > `True`
* `Style.Photon` > `True`
* `Style.WaveFox` > `True`
* `Style.Chrome` > `True`
* `Style.Edge` > `True`
* `Style.Australis` > `True`
* `Style.Chrome-Old` > `True`

If point 3 is not fulfilled, the tabs and everything connected with them will be by default, as the Mozilla intended.

Icons are no longer tied to tabs. They can be activated without having to complete step 3. Context menus will be by default

To enable icons, create one of the keys below:
* `Style.Menu-Icons-Regular` > `True`
* `Style.Menu-Icons-Filled` > `True`

## Tabs (Overflow mode)
Removed the ability to close tabs with the left mouse button in overflow mode to protect the user from accidental actions. Use the methods below to close tabs:
* Through the context menu
* By clicking on the mouse wheel
* `browser.tabs.closeTabByDblclick` > `True`
* `Ctrl + W` / `Command + W` closes the current tab
